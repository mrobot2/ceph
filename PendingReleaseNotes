* OSDMap's json-formatted dump changed for keys 'full' and 'nearfull'.
  What was previously being outputted as 'true' or 'false' strings are
  now being outputted 'true' and 'false' booleans according to json syntax.

* HEALTH_WARN on 'mon osd down out interval == 0'. Having this option set
  to zero on the leader acts much like having the 'noout' flag set.  This
  warning will only be reported if the monitor getting the 'health' or
  'status' request has this option set to zero.
